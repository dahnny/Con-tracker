## Con-tracker. :smile: 

This is a Dapp built on the celo block chain that enables users to track all transactions from different addresses in one place.
    
 ## Users can:
    * easily create an account to start using the Dapp
    * track transactions from normal addresses as well as contract addresses.
    * view all the previous transactions for a particular address.
    * view account balances for different tokens held by the address
    * Save and delete addresses.
    * Give addresses custom names for easy identification.
