## Con-tracker. :smile: 

This is a Dapp built on the celo block chain that enables users to track all transactions from different addresses in one place.
    Addresses are saved on the block chain, so users dont need to worry about things like refreshing the browser.
 ## Users can:
    * track transactions from normal addresses as well as contract addresses.
    * Save and delete addresses to track.
    * view all the previous transactions from the account
    * view account balances for different tokens held by the address
